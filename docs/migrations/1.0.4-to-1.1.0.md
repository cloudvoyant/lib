# Migration Guide: v1.0.4 to v1.1.0

> **Platform:** yin
> **From Version:** 1.0.4
> **To Version:** 1.1.0
> **Date:** 2025-01-08

## Overview

Version 1.1.0 completes the project scaffolding functionality that was a placeholder in v1.0.4. This is a feature release with no breaking changes.

## What Changed

### New Features

1. **Complete Scaffold Implementation** (`scripts/scaffold.sh`)
   - Was: 18-line placeholder with TODO comments
   - Now: 400+ line full implementation with interactive/non-interactive modes

2. **Platform Development Tools**
   - New script: `scripts/platform-install.sh` - Installs bats, shellcheck
   - New justfile commands: `just platform-install`, `just platform-test`
   - Comprehensive test suite: `test/scaffold.bats` (31 tests)

3. **Template System**
   - `README.template.md` - For scaffolded project READMEs
   - Sample files for testing case replacements

4. **Case-Aware Name Replacement**
   - Automatically converts project names to all formats (PascalCase, camelCase, snake_case, kebab-case, flatcase)

### Bug Fixes

- Added error handling and automatic rollback in scaffold.sh
- Fixed platform dependency installation across different OS

## Impact on Existing Projects

**None.** This is a non-breaking release.

If your project was scaffolded from v1.0.4, it will continue to work without any changes. The new features primarily benefit:
- **Platform developers** - Can now run tests and install deps easily
- **New projects** - Get better scaffolding experience

## Optional: Add Platform Tracking

If you want to track which platform version your project uses (enables future migrations):

**Add to `.envrc`:**
```bash
# Platform tracking (optional)
export NV_PLATFORM=yin
export NV_PLATFORM_VERSION=1.1.0
```

**Reload environment:**
```bash
direnv allow
```

This is entirely optional but recommended for future-proofing.

## For Platform Developers

If you're developing this platform itself:

### Install Development Dependencies

```bash
just platform-install
```

### Run Tests

```bash
just platform-test
```

Should show: `31 tests, 31 passing`

## No Action Required

**Existing scaffolded projects work as-is.** No migration steps needed.
